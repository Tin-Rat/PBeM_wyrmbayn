# **PBeM_wyrmbayn**
@Tin-Rat
## Wyrmbayn is a fantasy PBeM.
## This is going to be a demonstration of a simple PBeM game. Inspired by 'https://github.com/ravenzachary/Far-Horizons' it will however be based on the surface of a planet and set in a (much) earlier era. The world map will be similar to a hex map but folded in certain places so be a finite but unbounded space. It will not be a toroidal shape however, but will approximate to a platonic solid and will therefore be roughly spherical. Any location will have the option to move in any of six directions, however because of the aformentioned folds sometimes (in a limited number of locations) moving in say direction '3' and '4' will bring you to the same location.
## The world map is basically a hex map imposed on a net formed from a truncated icosahedron. The classical icosahedron has 20 faces, 12 vertices and 30 edges. Our interpretation allows for a total of 42 hexes, comprising 12 on the vertices (should really be pentagons), 30 on the edges (one per edge, of which there are thirty) and 0 on the faces (zero per face of which there are twenty).
## Attached files in Map folder give a basic view of the planets surface locations.
