# PBeM_wyrmbayn
# Wyrmbayn is a fantasy PBeM.
# This is going to be a demonstration of a simple PBeM game. Inspired by 'https://github.com/ravenzachary/Far-Horizons' it will however be based on the surface of a planet and set in a (much) earlier era. The world map will be similar to a hex map but folded in certain places so be a finite but unbounded space. It will not be a toroidal shape however, but will approximate to a plutonic solid and will therefore be roughly spherical. Any location will have the option to move in any of six directions, however because of the aformentioned folds sometimes (in a limited number of locations) moving in say direction '3' and '4' will bring you to the same location.
# Attached files Epsilon1.png and Epsilon2.png overlap to give a map of the planets surface.
