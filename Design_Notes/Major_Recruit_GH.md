# The matrix (spreadsheet printout) shows the 
# percentage chance of recruiting a Major Character (MC) 
# by another in both 'Favourable Locations' and elsewhere 
# (Unfavourable Locations if you like).
#
# The 'Recruiter' column identifys the Major Character issuing the
# 'Recruit' order.  The Candidate refers to the Major Character being 
# recruited. If the recruiting MC is located on terrain of the same type
# as the 'Favorable Location' then the higher pecentage chance of a 
# successful hiring will take place. For example with regards to line 1 
# on sheet 1, an Alchemist has a 99% chance of recruiting an 
# Archaeologist when he (the Alchemist) is located in a 'Church' 
# location, but only a 52% chance if he was in say a Scrapyard, 
# for example.
