# It depicts a map with forty two locations which can be
# navigated by travelling in any of six directions. It also 
# doubles as a net for a truncated icosahedron fold-up 3D solid
# (very roughly spherical) where the 12 vertices and 30 edges
# are utilized to define the 42 regions, which can be used to
# define a ‘play area’ for pbem games such as ‘wyrmbayn’ (under
# development).

# Locations ‘AA’, ‘AC’, ‘CC’, ‘EC’, ‘GC’, ‘IC’, ‘AE’, ‘CE’,
# ‘EE’, ‘GE’, ‘IE’ and ‘CG’ technically only have five
# neighbouring locations each. Rather than blocking movement in
# one direction, it is possibly easier to arrange that say for
# example in the case of location ‘CC’ that moving by either
# direction one or two will result in landing on ‘DC’. Other
# said locations will have to have similar adaptions.

# It is envisaged that the turn report will give a list of the
# five or six adjoining locations that a particular Character
# could move to. So that most player will probably just a 
# ‘Move to’ orders rather than ‘Move in direction number’ type
# orders.  So a Count located at say ‘DD’ would most probably
# submit ‘Move to EE’ rather than ‘Move 3’, although they would
# result in an equivalent outcome.

# Locations ‘AB’, ‘BB’, ‘DB’ and etc. suffer from ‘edge
# effects’ where it is more difficult to compute a ‘Move in
# direction number’ outcome, but as mentioned above turnsheets
# should give all the available options for any particular
# Character based on their location at turn-end.
